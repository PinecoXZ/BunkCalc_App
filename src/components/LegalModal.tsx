              <p>BunkCalc ("the App", "we", "our", "us") is an attendance-tracking application developed by <a href="https://github.com/PinecoXZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 font-bold underline">PinecoXZ</a>. This Privacy Policy describes how the App handles information when you use BunkCalc on the web (https://bunk-calc-web.vercel.app/) or personal device. By using BunkCalc, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy.</p>

              <h3 className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-bold text-lg mb-2">2. Our Privacy Commitment</h3>
              <p>BunkCalc is designed with a <span className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-bold">local-first, zero-collection architecture</span>. All your data — including attendance records, subject schedules, semester preferences, and application settings — is stored exclusively on your device using the platform's native encrypted key-value storage (SharedPreferences on Android). We do not operate backend servers, databases, cloud infrastructure, or analytics platforms of any kind.</p>
              <p className="mt-2">In simple terms: <span className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-bold italic">your data never leaves your device</span>.</p>

              <p>We want to be unambiguous. BunkCalc does <span className="font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">not</span> collect, transmit, store on remote servers, or share with any third parties:</p>

              <p>BunkCalc requests the following device permissions solely for the features described below. Each permission is opt-in and can be revoked at any time through your device's system settings.</p>
              <div className="mt-3 space-y-3">
                <div className="bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800/50 p-3 rounded-xl">

                  <p className="text-xs">Used for optional biometric app lock. Verification is executed entirely through the Android OS BiometricPrompt API within the device's secure hardware enclave (TEE/Secure Element). BunkCalc NEVER accesses, stores, reads, or transmits biometric templates, raw fingerprints, or facial data.</p>
                </div>

                  <p className="text-xs">Used to deliver scheduled class reminders before lectures, post-class attendance marking prompts, and threshold alerts when your attendance falls below the configured minimum. Notifications are scheduled locally on-device using the system alarm manager and are never routed through external push notification services.</p>

              <p>The Backup feature exports your data as a plain JSON file saved to your device's local storage. The Restore feature reads a previously exported JSON backup. Both operations are initiated manually by you and occur entirely on-device. We have no access to these backup files.</p>

              <p>When you use the "Share Attendance Card" feature, BunkCalc renders your attendance summary as a PNG image on-device using HTML canvas rendering. When using Timetable Cloud & QR Sharing, timetable payloads are encoded into compact anonymous strings without any personal identifiable information. We do not intercept, track, or retain any personal content.</p>

              <p>BunkCalc is built using the open-source <span className="font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">Apache Capacitor</span> framework. Capacitor plugins operate locally and do not transmit data to external servers. The App does not integrate any third-party analytics SDKs (Google Analytics, Firebase, Mixpanel, etc.), advertising networks, social media trackers, or crash reporting services.</p>

            <section>
              <h3 className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-bold text-lg mb-2">8. Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
              <p>Your data persists on your device until you take one of the following actions:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>Use the <span className="font-bold text-slate-900 dark:text-white">Reset App</span> function in Settings &gt; Data Management</li>
                <li>Clear the app's data or cache through your device's system settings</li>

              </ul>
              <p className="mt-2">Since all data is local, deletion is immediate and permanent. We cannot recover your data after deletion as we never had access to it.</p>

              <h3 className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-bold text-lg mb-2">9. Children's Privacy</h3>
              <p>BunkCalc is designed for university and college students (typically aged 17+). We do not knowingly target or collect data from children under the age of 13. Since no data is collected from any user, this policy applies uniformly regardless of age.</p>

            <section>
              <h3 className="text-slate-900 dark:text-white font-bold text-lg mb-2">10. Changes to This Policy</h3>
              <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the app with an updated "Effective Date" at the top of this document. Continued use of BunkCalc after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
